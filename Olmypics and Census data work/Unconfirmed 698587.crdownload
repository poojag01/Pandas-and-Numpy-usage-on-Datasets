# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on
# [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 
# 
# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games,
# total # of medals.

# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# ### Question 4

# Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.

# ## Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov).
# Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States.
# This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015.
# [ See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.

# Which state has the most counties in it? 
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

def answer_five() :
    temp = census_df[census_df.SUMLEV == 50 ]

# ### Question 6

# **Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.
# 
# *This function should return a list of string values.*

# ### Question 7

# Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
# 
# e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

#    print( type(temp_diff))
#    print( temp_diff.idxmax() )

    return ( temp_diff.idxmax() )
    

# ### Question 8
# In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 
# 
# Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
# 
# *This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*

    filter1 = (census_df['CTYNAME'].str.startswith('Washington') )
